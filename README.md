Advanced Software Techniques - Assignment 2: Creating Guessing Game and Running it Using a MAKEFILE (WIN/LINUX)

Advanced Software Techniques
Assignment 2 - Makefile
Individual submission
Introduction
For the second assignment you will use the code you created in the recent quiz, and modify the makefile
to make the solution more portable.
The requirements of the program are the same as the quiz, and you may make any changes you feel
necessary.
Minimum Requirements
1. The program is a console program and may be written in C or C++.
2. All related functions should be in separate source files.
3. Game functions:
a. Create random number
b. Determine if guess is too high (return 1), too low (return -1) or correct (return 0)
4. User interface functions:
a. Ask the user for a guess and validate it is an integer
b. Tell the user the result of the guess
5. No global variables are permitted
6. The upper limit of the guessing range must be specified by a #define statement
7. Use a makefile early in the process but you must use macros extensively.
8. Create a second makefile with appropriate macro definitions to compile the solution on a Linux
system (Ubuntu preferred).
Please submit your solution to the D2L dropbox in a zipped folder. Include only the source files and the 2
makefiles.
